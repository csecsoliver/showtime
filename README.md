# showtime
An unofficial time booking interface for the mfm project in hungary.
The project is in a usable state, not everything works as envisioned, but I plan to finish it despite neighborhood (the main motivator) being cancelled.
You can access a shipped verion on https://show-time.ddns.net which is functional, but not including the lastest features.

Use google translate to use, if you're not familiar with hungarian. Just paste the link into the input field, and click on the outputted link.
The teacher/-s must first Register on the site and create workshops to their likings. To publish them click on the invite button and choose the workshop and input the participant emails.
Each participant will be sent an email, which provides an invite link where the parents can confirm participation of their children.
