# Show Time!
An unofficial time booking interface for the mfm project in hungary.
The project is in a usable state, not everything works as envisioned, but I plan to finish it despite neighborhood (the main motivator) being cancelled.

Use google translate to use, if you're not familiar with hungarian. Just paste the link into the input field, and click on the outputted link.
The teacher/-s must first Register on the site and create workshops to their likings. To publish them click on the invite button and choose the workshop and input the participant emails.
Each participant will be sent an email, which provides an invite link where the parents can confirm participation of their children.

The app is being made mainly for my mother, who organises workshops for teenage girls (with a counterpart for boys too) about their bodies and fertility in the form of an interactive drama.

# Some ramblings
This is a very niche project specifically made to meet my mother's needs. It was originally supposed to be submitted for neighborhood, which unfortunately got cancelled a week before I was supposed to get on the flight to San Francisco from Hungary. Unlucky for me, I wasn't done with all the requirements, so not all of the (quite expensive) plane ticket was covered by HC. This all combined made me real demotivated to work on this at all, but I hope some of you find this at least a little interesting.
